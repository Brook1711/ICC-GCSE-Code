# Codes for the ICC 2024 paper: [Wavenumber Domain Sparse Channel Estimation in Holographic MIMO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11071.pdf)

## Brief Description
The main codes are organized in several jupyter notebooks. 
- `alg_GCSE_WND.ipynb` 
- `alg_GCSE_AD.ipynb`
- `alg_OMP_WND.ipynb` 
- `alg_OMP_AD.ipynb`

Github preview may not display the math formula correctly. Please download the notebook and run it in your local environment.
Or just check the html version in the `doc` folder.

### Notation
please create a `data` folder at the root and run the channel generation code in `generate_channel.ipynb` to generate the channel data.
